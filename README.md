# info-extraction-from-RC-images


1) Simple Computer vision project for extracting some required information from images of RC's.

2) [Google vision api](https://cloud.google.com/vision) is used for detecting text from image and converting those text into digital text.

3) rc_cred.json is the credential file for accessing the api.

As the detected text is not in a structured form , some basic logics are used to handle the output and extracting out the needed information.
